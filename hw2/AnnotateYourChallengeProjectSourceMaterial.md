In this activity, you will work with your classmates to create a collaborative annotated bibliography for everyone to use throughout the project. Each student will select, read, and annotate three of the project source materials that are provided in the Project Materials module at the top of the Modules section.

## Purpose:

In this activity, you will be contributing to a collaborative annotated bibliography document, along with everyone else in the course. The purpose of this assignment is for you to become familiar with the source materials you will use to answer your driving question and your need to knows. The annotated bibliography will help you synthesize the information in the sources and compare and contrast various viewpoints and pieces of data that are in the sources. To support that process, this activity will lead to development of annotations for all or many of the sources, so that you can all more easily find information you need throughout the project.

## Assignment Steps:

- 1. Navigate to the Modules page of the course (using the left-hand course navigation menu). From the Modules page, find the Project Materials module at the top. Browse the project source materials that are provided in that module and select 3 items that are of interest to you, and that no one else has already selected. For those you have selected, copy the titles and links. In the next step, you will paste them into a Collaborations document.
- 2. Navigate to the Collaborations page of the course (using the left-hand course menu), then open the file called Annotated Project Source Material. Make sure no one has already selected the items you are interested in. Paste the titles and links for the 3 unique sources that you selected in assignment step 1 into this document. Put each one in a separate row of the table. Put your name next to each item that you have pasted here.
- 3. Read each source you have selected, then write a 200-word annotation in the table, next to the source title. In your annotation, answer the following questions:
  - What are the big ideas that are presented or discussed?
  - Which of your need to knows might be answered by the material?
  - Which section(s) of the project might this source inform?

## Criteria for Success:

- Read each source thoroughly.
- Write your annotation in your own words, i.e., don't cut-and-paste from the source.
- Focus on how the source will help you with your proposal.
