# Brainstorm your "Need to Knows"

No unread replies.No replies.
The first step in your problem solving process is to identify what you need to know in order to respond to the driving question. This is a quick brainstorming exercise. To begin, review the problem statement, the driving question, and the description of the project that you will be producing. Then, create a quick bulleted list of what you think you need to know in order to come up with a response to the driving question and create a workable solution to the problem. You may think you know very little at this point. That's okay. Start making your list. One idea may lead to another.
